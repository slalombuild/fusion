<br>
You will need to output a json file with `fusion gen snippets -e vscode -o filename.json` and place it and `package.json` from the repository's snippets directory within `.../.vscode/extensions/fusion-snippets`, creating directories if needed. Restart your IDE to make them available.

### Intellij

```bash
# 1. Generate snippets
fusion gen snippets -e intellij -o filename.xml

# 2. Find your IDE's configuration directory

# 3. Create a directory within that called `templates` if it does not already exist, and drop the xml file in there. Then, restart your IDE to make them available.
```
